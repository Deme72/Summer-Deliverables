Assets that are absolutely fundamental to this project's workings.
Base assets (the ones we inherit from) will probably be the bulk of the content here. 

i.e.: GameMode, PlayerController, BaseCharacter, etc. are the type of things that go here.

Note: The only people allowed to edit these are people who are directly working on these. Otherwise, treat them as base classes or types you can inherit from.
